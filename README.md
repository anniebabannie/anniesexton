# Bootstrap Middleman

A collection of libraries and helpers to quickly set up a Bootstrap and Middleman site.

* Clone the repository
* Run `bundle install`
* Run `middleman`

You can customize the Bootstrap configuration by editing: `source/css/bootstrap/_bootstrap.scss` and `source/css/bootstrap/_variables.scss`

This is the easiest way that I have found to quickly set up a static site with Bootstrap, Sass, Compass, and Middleman.

I've also added [holder.js](http://imsky.github.io/holder/) for mocking up quick images with no HTTP requests.
